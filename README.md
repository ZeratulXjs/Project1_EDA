# Machine Learning Practice Project 1 

### This is a project to help me practice the data import and Exploratory Data Analysis steps before building a machine learning model.

This project uses the publically available **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Data set** hosted on 
Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data)[https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/breast-cancer-wisconsin-data]

I intend to apply the steps taught in the last 2 weeks ie;

1. Data retrieval
2. Data cleaning (removing/imputing missing values and outliers)
3. Checking features using plots/ visualisations
4. Feature engineering such as transformations for linear regression modelling
5. Hypothesis testing

### Core applications used

1. Jupyter notebooks within the Anaconda suite of programs

### How to use this 

1. Install Anaconda
2. Within Anaconda, run the Jupyter Notebooks server
3. Open the Notebook `EDA_practice.ipynb` notebook 
4. Follow through the instructions


Enjoy!
